# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

<p>This repository is my submission for the final project for the coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data". The end product is a tidy data set of data collected <br> from the accelerometers
from the Samsung Galacy S smartphone and that can be used for later analysis.</p>

**Initial Data Pulled:**
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

**Files:**
*CodeBook.md* - a description of the code and step-by-step walkthrough of all data, variables, and transformations I used

*run_analysis.R*  - script that prepares the raw data and outputs a tidydata file of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

*FinalData.txt* - the file produced by run_analysis.R
